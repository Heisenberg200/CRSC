## Autor: Corman Daniel
In this aboratory work I have created an application that allows the user to simply manage the .audit files. It has s simple GUI 
that allows the user to interact more properly to the application. Here there is also a parser that parses the .audit files and stores them.
Also there is a search bar that allows to brows through the files. As tool I have used java prograwmming language and JavaFX framework for the GUI.
